How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Finding differences and identifying the typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By seeing my mistakes and realizing improvements

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are I do not have to worry about the corrections in automatically
    but I can not control the changes, however in manually choosing to make the 
    commit I can control those changes if I favor but the cons are that I have 
    to do it frequently.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To make a general version of a project and not only in a simple file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Getting the ids of the changes whith git log and using diff to see the diferences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By having several versions that I am sure are correct and be confident that 
    those run ok.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I am taking this course for can take the Android one and now I would like
    to use it for my first app.
