When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your local work?

You create because you need a fast change and you are sure.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because of the control of the changes made.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

I understood forks is for cloning a repository only from Github to Github, I mean it will be remote.
Instead, clones is the same idea as forks but it is locally, from Github to local repository.
And branches works only locally, it is used for separate a project in any amount  branches are needed.
