When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your local work?

You create because you need a fast change and you are sure.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because of the control of the changes made.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

I understood forks is for cloning a repository only from Github to Github, I mean it will be remote.
Instead, clones is the same idea as forks but it is locally, from Github to local repository.
And branches works only locally, it is used for separate a project in any amount  branches are needed.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that I can see the changes made and have a reference for future issues and errors.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I think you can use other technologies like share folders or something like that. I think in big
projects with a big amount of participant it would be easier using Git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

When you want an optional version of the master one, this for experiment or of convenience.
The benefits are that you do not have to modify the master.
