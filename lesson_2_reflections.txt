What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates the files needed for the respository and Git. And I need to do this
to follow a history and manage the repository with this control vrsion.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different to working space because the first one is a previous
place before go to the repository and the second one (stage area) does not means 
it belongs to the repository yet, it will be until commit the files that are in
staging area.
